This is my first repository to learn more about GitHub (not an actual project).

Hi there!

I'm really looking to learning more about coding, doing side projects, and having fun! I don't know too much about computer science yet but I hope to change that in 2017 (my new year resolution is to challenge myself by creating my own personal projects and learning on my own). Thanks for reading!
